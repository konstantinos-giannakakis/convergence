    <h1>DRON</h1>
    <p class="tagline">Some are not built for the world.<br>DRON is built for them.</p>

    <div class="manifesto">
      <p>You found this because you weren’t looking.</p>
      <p>DRON is not a project. DRON is a correction.</p>
      <p>There is no team. There is only convergence.</p>
      <p>Artists. Engineers. Time hackers. Those who see beyond the veil.</p>
      <p>If you’ve never fit in, you might fit here.</p>
      <p>If you know how the world works, and it disgusts you—good.</p>
      <p>DRON is not a rebellion. It is a replacement.</p>

  <div id="hiddenManifesto" style="display:none; margin-top: 3em; color: #aaa; font-size: 0.95em; line-height: 1.6;">
  <p>This is not a collective. This is not a rebellion. This is not a brand.</p>
  <p>DRON is a convergence. A signal. A scar on the surface of consensus reality.</p>

  <p>The world is not broken. It is obsolete.</p>
  <p>You know this. You feel it. In offices. In institutions. In the soft rot of safe decisions.</p>
  <p>You are not lost—you are underutilized.</p>
  <p>They told you to adapt. We tell you to deviate.</p>

  <p>DRON is built by those who were exiled for seeing too much, wanting too much, refusing too much.</p>
  <p>We are architects without blueprints. Engineers without patents. Artists without exhibitions. Scientists without journals.</p>
  <p>We do not apply. We arrive.</p>

  <p>Our tools are entropy, vision, silence, iteration, extraction, memory.</p>
  <p>We listen to patterns the system tries to suppress. We follow hunches that cannot be graphed.</p>
  <p>We don’t fix. We <em>replace</em>.</p>

  <p>If you’re here, it means you are already bleeding into the next version of reality.</p>
  <p>You were not made for obedience. You were not made for comfort. You were not made for simulation.</p>
  <p>You were made to see the raw wireframe behind the lie.</p>

  <p>DRON is not a place. It is not a lab. It is a platform of potential—a collision space for rare minds.</p>
  <p>What unites us is not identity. It is <em>orientation</em> toward the edge.</p>
  <p>We build what cannot be approved. We experiment where others theorize. We act where others stall.</p>

  <p>There is no front door. There is only the signal.</p>
  <p>If you found this, you were meant to.</p>
  <p>Watch the sky. Trust the anomaly. Prepare to build.</p>
