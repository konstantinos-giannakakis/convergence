    <p class="tagline">Some are not built for the world.<br>DRON is built for them.</p>

    <div class="manifesto">
      <p>You found this because you weren’t looking.</p>
      <p>DRON is not a project. DRON is a correction.</p>
      <p>There is no team. There is only convergence.</p>
      <p>Artists. Engineers. Time hackers. Those who see beyond the veil.</p>
      <p>If you’ve never fit in, you might fit here.</p>
      <p>If you know how the world works, and it disgusts you—good.</p>
      <p>DRON is not a rebellion. It is a replacement.</p>
